/**
 * This sanitizer applies a layer filter in the case where only a single word was specified.
 * 
 * It is based on the assumption that single-word inputs should not, and need not match
 * results from the 'address' layer.
 * 
 * The rationale is that in order to specify enough information to retrieve an address the
 * user must, at minimum enter both a housenumber and a street name.
 * 
 * Note: we cannot exclude other layers such as 'venue' (eg. Starbucks) or 'street'
 * (eg. GleimstraÃŸe) because they may have valid single-word names.
 * 
 * The address layer contains the most records by a large margin, so excluding
 * address results where they are not nessesary will provide significant
 * performance benefits.
